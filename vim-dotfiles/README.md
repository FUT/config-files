============

Vim settings presented here are being actively developed. 

To install clone repo in any location. Run <t>setup.sh</t> to install current configuration on your computer. 

Root privileges will be required to install some packages. All root operations were moved to the end of the file, thus you may run script with default privileges and exit when root access will be required. In that case you should fix all missing dependencies by yourself.
